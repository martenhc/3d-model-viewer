**3D model viewer made with Lit.**

The idea is to export this as an standalone web component when finished.

### Features

The module will be able to receive a .glb model and an optional list of hotspots and information which will be rendered on top of the model.

A tool to calculate the hotspots coordinates will be built after the module is ready.
